# MeshGenerator

A small Unity prototype that generates polygonal surfaces of spheres represented as signed distance fields.
Two algorithms are implemented as compute shaders to generate the mesh: Marching Cubes and Surface Net.
The overview of each algorithm is found here: https://cerbion.net/blog/understanding-surface-nets/.

To run the project, simply open the project in a Unity Editor and run.
Simple functionality is implemented to manipulate the spheres. To drag the spheres, simply click and drag.
To change the size of each sphere, scroll on the ball representing the sphere
